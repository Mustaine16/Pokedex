# Pokedex
Hi everyone! This is my first "web-app" (in fact, i dont know if i can call it as that beacause it just vainilla Javascript but who cares), just a simple Pokedex based on the public [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/)


## How it works?

As you can see in the code, every time the user click on a pokemon it shoot a function that fetch the pokemon's data and incrust it in a modal, simple as that
